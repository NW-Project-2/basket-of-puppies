# basket-of-puppies
"Basket of Puppies" is a check in site designed for employees of a doggie day care to keep track of the clients and dogs. The homepage starts where the employee inserts their login with a username and password.
A new owner can be entered with information about their dog including shot records, medication needs, alternate pickup contact and other notes. 
There is a page to view all the owner information, as well as one for the dog information, and an activities page that keeps track of how frequently they have been walked or taken medication. 

# Technologies Used
-Passport is used for the login and password handling
-Toastr is used for pop up messages
-Handlebars was implemented for the HTML handling
-Sequelize and MySQL2 handle the database information
-Moment.js for the date and time
-AJAX call to OpenWeatherMap for the weather info

# User Story
As an employee of a doggie day care, I would like an easy way to confidentially log in and store information pertaining to the clients and pets, keeping track of their activities on a daily basis.
